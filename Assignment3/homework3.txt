Problem 6.2.   Due September 30th(Friday) 4:00 pm

Your program should work under commendline

Python program.py <sequence>

instructions:

1. Your program will be tested using the two sequences given in the problem, and some random sequences as well. The random sequences will be very similar to the given sequence(it will still be 9 numbers and a permutation of 1,2,3).

2. You can hard-coded the hidden Markov model in Fig. 6.3 inside your program.
